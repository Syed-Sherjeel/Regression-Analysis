# BMI Modelling - a Linear regression problem
Purpose of this project is to analyse and model relationship between Life expectancy and BMI with help of data of different countries.Moreover,we will also give u short refresher of linear regression before diving into process.

# Installing dependencies
```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
```
Now your setup is ready for running this project.
# Usage Example
Our main code in written in a well documented notebook that explains everything perform data acquistion to data preprocessing and eventually data modelling with various contraints.
However here are some usage examples,
```
X_predict=value_of_BMI
bmi_model.predict([X])
```
where X_train is a set of features on which our data will make predictions in following order.
